SUMMARY
=======

This is a C++ implementation of CS2 min-cost-max-flow scaling algorithm. 

This is intended to be one of the cleanest and simplest to use minimum-cost 
max-flow (MCMF) implementation using C++.  If you have a C++ application in 
which you need to use a MCMF algo, then this may be your most elegant bet.
See main() function for an example of how to use it.

I compiled it on Linux Fedora, using g++.  If you have any  question please 
contact Cristinel.


CREDITS
=======

This is an adapted (i.e., ported to C++) version of the faimous CS2 algo;
CS2 is the second version of scaling algorithm for minimum-cost max-flow 
problems.  For a detailed description of this famous algo, see:
A.V. Goldberg, "An Efficient Implementation of a Scaling Minimum-Cost 
Flow Algorithm", Journal of Algorithms, vol. 22, pp. 1-29, 1997.

CS2 was developed by Andrew Goldberg (goldberg@intertrust.com) and
Boris Cherkassky (cher@cher.msk.su).

The original C version is located in cs2-4.3/
